Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains some sample codes that are designed to help you learn multi-threading development in C#.

Each sample code has a corresponding illustration that is available on my LinkedIn profile. The illustrations will help you understand the concepts and see how the code works in practice.

The first sample code in this repository is a program that runs two loops concurrently and joins the second thread to the first one. This is a simple example that demonstrates how threads can be used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously and improve application performance.

I hope you find these samples helpful in your journey to learn multi-threading development in C#. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me on LinkedIn.
